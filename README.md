# News-Website
- A small project for increasing my development skills using JavaScript and APIs.
- The site is full responsive and supports most of the devices.
- I have used Newsapi for fetch realtime data for the website.
- The newsapi doesnot allow to use the data fetched from it in commerial purposes and deplyments, So i have not deployed the site.
- If you want to see, You can clone the repo and run it in the local host.

# Fuctions
- Category wise News display - General , Business , Entertainment , etc
- User can search for a particular news using a keyword.
- User can click on a particular news to read about it in more detail.
